		<b>Researcher</b><br>
		ETH Zurich<br>
		Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering<br>
		Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control<br><br>

		<b>Incoming Assistant Professor (Fall 2024)</b><br>
		Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br>
		Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)<br>
		Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering<br>
		Institute for Data, Systems and Society (IDSS)<br><br>



			I recently defended my doctoral thesis in <a href="https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli.html" target="_blank">Prof. Emilio Frazzoli's group</a>, at the Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control, ETH Zurich.
			
			I am currently serving as a PI and will be joining the faculty at MIT in Fall 2024 (I am <a href="group.html">recruiting</a>!</b></font>).
			Before joining MIT, I will spend few months as a Postdoc at Stanford University, working with Marco Pavone.
			I received my BSc. and MSc. in Mechanical Engineering with focus in Robotics, Systems and Control from ETH Zurich in 2017 and 2019, respectively. 
			I spent time in Singapore at <a href="https://www.aptiv.com/autonomous-mobility" target="_blank">nuTonomy</a> (then Aptiv, now Motional), at Stanford University, in Marco Pavone's  <a href="http://asl.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Autonomous Systems Lab</a>, and at MIT.
		<br><br>
			Driven by societal challenges, the goal of my research is to develop efficient computational tools and algorithmic approaches to formulate and solve complex, interconnected system design and autonomous decision making problems.
			My interests include the co-design complex systems (all the way from future mobility systems to autonomous systems), compositionality in engineering, planning and control, and game theory.
			I am the recipient of an award (keynote talk) for our paper at the 2021 Applied Category Theory Conference, and of the Best Paper Award (1st Place) at the 2021 24th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC).
		<br><br>
			I created the <em>Autonomy Talks</em> at ETH Zurich. Check out our <a href="https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli/autonomy-talks.html" target="_blank">webpage</a>, have a look at the (over 150) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOjPogOkotlO-nrJ1Pw2hWMpqh7E-_L97" target="_blank">recorded talks</a> and contact me if you want to be the next speaker!
