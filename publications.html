						This paper introduces an automatic control method designed to enhance the operation of  electric vehicles, besides the  speed tracking objectives, by including reliability and lifetime requirements. 
						The research considers  an automotive power converter which supplies electric power to a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). 
						The primary control objective is to mitigate the thermal stress on the power electronic Insulate Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs), while simultaneously ensuring effective speed tracking performance. 
						To achieve these goals, we propose  an extended  $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ design framework, which includes reliability models. 
						The method is tested in two distinct scenarios: reliability-aware, and reliability-free cases. 
						Furthermore, the paper conducts a lifetime analysis of the IGBTs, leveraging the Rainflow algorithm and temperature data.

						The evolution of existing transportation systems, mainly driven by urbanization and increased availability of mobility options, such as private, profit-maximizing ride-hailing companies, calls for tools to reason about their design and regulation.
						To study this complex sociotechnical problem, one needs to account for the strategic interactions of the heterogeneous stakeholders involved in the mobility ecosystem and analyze how they influence the system.
						In this paper, we focus on the interactions between citizens who compete for the limited resources of a mobility system to complete their desired trip. 
						Specifically, we present a game-theoretic framework for multi-modal mobility systems, where citizens, characterized by heterogeneous preferences, have access to various mobility options and seek individually-optimal decisions.
						We study the arising game and prove the existence of an equilibrium, which can be efficiently computed via a convex optimization problem.
						Through both an analytical and a numerical case study for the classic scenario of Sioux Falls, USA, we illustrate the capabilities of our model and perform sensitivity analyses.
						Importantly, we show how to embed our framework into an "larger" game among stakeholders of the mobility ecosystem (e.g., municipality, Mobility Service Providers (MSPs), and citizens), effectively giving rise to tools to inform strategic interventions and policy-making in the mobility ecosystem.

						Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) offer a sustainable alternative to Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs).
						This paper addresses some of the challenges faced by the automotive industry and the scientific community in defining the technology for the next generation of automotive power converters. 
						The focus is on achieving reduced CO2 emissions, improved energy efficiency, and reliability, while minimizing costs to enable large-scale adoption of BEVs and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). 
						The paper leverages an automotive converter equipped with the recently developed Adjustable Hybrid Switch (AHS) based electric gear and proposes a reliability-based control algorithm for operating the converter E-Gear (EG) of BEVs. 
						By integrating reliability control principles, the proposed algorithm minimizes system damage over time and enhances the converter's lifetime. 
						The case studies, based on standardised driving cycles, demonstrate the benefits of the presented approach in terms of energy losses and lifetime expectations.
						Overall, this work contributes a novel approach to drivetrain control in BEVs, highlighting the potential of the proposed control strategy to improve energy efficiency and reliability. 
						The research findings provide valuable insights for the development of next-generation automotive power converters.

								The design of future mobility solutions (autonomous vehicles, micromobility solutions, etc.) and the design of the mobility systems they enable
								are closely coupled. Indeed, knowledge about the intended service of novel mobility solutions would impact their design and deployment process,
								whilst insights about their technological development could significantly affect transportation management policies. This requires tools to study
								such a coupling and co-design future mobility systems in terms of different objectives. This paper presents a framework to address such co-design
								problems. In particular, we leverage the recently developed mathematical theory of co-design to frame and solve the problem of designing and
								deploying an intermodal mobility system, whereby autonomous vehicles service travel demands jointly with micromobility solutions such as shared
								bikes and e- scooters, and public transit, in terms of fleets sizing, vehicle char- acteristics, and public transit service frequency.
								Our framework is modular and compositional, allowing one to describe the design problem as the interconnection of its individual components and
								to tackle it from a system-level perspective. Moreover, it only requires very general monotonicity assumptions and it naturally handles multiple
								objectives, delivering the rational solutions on the Pareto front and thus enabling policy makers to select a policy. To showcase our methodology,
								we present a real- world case study for Washington D.C., USA. Our work suggests that it is possible to create user-friendly optimization tools
								to systematically assess the costs and benefits of interventions, and that such analytical techniques might inform policy-making in the future.

									In many applications of category theory it is useful to reason about “negative information”. 
									For example, in planning problems, providing an optimal solution is the same as giving a feasible solution (the “positive” information) together with a proof of the fact that there cannot be feasible solutions better than the one given (the “negative” information). 
									We model negative information by introducing the concept of “norphisms”, as opposed to the positive information of morphisms. 
									A “nategory” is a category that has “Nom”-sets in addition to hom-sets, and specifies the compatibility rules between norphisms and morphisms. 
									With this setup we can choose to work in “coherent” “subnategories”: subcategories that describe a potential instantiation of the world in which all morphisms and norphisms are compatible. 
									We derive the composition rules for norphisms in a coherent subnategory; we show that norphisms do not compose by themselves, but rather they need to use morphisms as catalysts.
									We have two distinct rules of the type morphism+norphism→norphism. 
									We then show that those complex rules for norphism inference are actually as natural as the ones for morphisms, from the perspective of enriched category theory. 
									Every small category is enriched over P = ⟨Set, ×, 1⟩. We show that we can derive the machinery of norphisms by considering an enrichment over a certain monoidal category called PN (for “positive”/“negative”). In summary, we show that an alternative to considering negative information using logic on top of the categorical formalization is to “categorify” the negative information, obtaining negative arrows that live at the same level as the positive arrows, and suggest that the new inference rules are born of the same substance from the perspective of enriched category theory.

					When designing autonomous systems, we need to consider multiple trade-offs at various abstraction levels, and the choices of single (hardware and software) components need to be studied jointly. 
					In this work we consider the problem of designing the control algorithm as well as the platform on which it is executed. 
					In particular, we focus on vehicle control systems, and formalize state-of-the-art control schemes as monotone feasibility relations. 
					We then show how, leveraging a monotone theory of co-design, we can study the embedding of control synthesis problems into the task-driven co-design problem of a robotic platform. 
					The properties of the proposed approach are illustrated by considering urban driving scenarios. 
					We show how, given a particular task, we can efficiently compute Pareto optimal design solutions.

							Visual navigation for insect-scale robots is very challenging because in such a small scale, the size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints do not appear to permit visual navigation techniques such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) because they are likely to be too power-hungry. 
							We propose to use a biology-inspired approach, which we term the bilinear optic flow approximation, that is more computationally efficient. 
							We build on previous work that has shown that the bilinear approximation can be used for visual servoing. 
							Here, we show that a bilinear approximator can be learned that is able to stabilize the heading of a robot while performing continuous forward motion in a corridor-shaped environment. 
							This is a necessary capability for confined-space navigation that insect-sized robots are likely to perform. 
							In this work, we describe the underlining methodology of the method and built a 2D visual simulation environment and omnidirectional camera model to validate our results.

						Modern applications require robots to comply with multiple, often conflicting rules and to interact with the other agents.
						We present Posetal Games as a class of games in which each player expresses a preference over the outcomes via a partially ordered set of metrics.
						This allows one to combine hierarchical priorities of each player with the interactive nature of the environment.
						By contextualizing standard game theoretical notions, we provide two sufficient conditions on the preference of the players to prove existence of pure Nash Equilibria in finite action sets.
						Moreover, we define formal operations on the preference structures and link them to a refinement of the game solutions, showing how the set of equilibria can be systematically shrunk.
						The presented results are showcased in a driving game where autonomous vehicles select from a finite set of trajectories.

					We consider the problem of formally co-designing embodied intelligence as a whole, from hardware components such as chassis and sensors
					to software modules such as control and perception pipelines. We propose a principled approach to formulate and solve complex embodied
					intelligence co- design problems, leveraging a monotone co-design theory. The methods we propose are intuitive and integrate
					heterogeneous engineering disciplines, allowing analytical and simulation- based modeling techniques and enabling interdisciplinarity.
					We illustrate through a case study how, given a set of desired behaviors, our framework is able to compute Pareto efficient solutions
					for the entire hardware and software stack of a self- driving vehicle.

					Increasing urbanization and exacerbation of sustainability goals threaten the operational efficiency of current transportation systems and confront cities
					with complex choices with huge impact on future generations. At the same time, the rise of private, profit-maximizing Mobility Service Providers leveraging
					public resources, such as ride-hailing companies, entangles current regulation schemes. This calls for tools to study such complex socio-technical problems.
					In this paper, we provide a game-theoretic framework to study interactions between stakeholders of the mobility ecosystem, modeling regulatory aspects such
					as taxes and public transport prices, as well as operational matters for Mobility Service Providers such as pricing strategy, fleet sizing, and vehicle design.
					Our framework is modular and can readily accommodate different types of Mobility Service Providers, actions of municipalities, and low-level models of customers
					choices in the mobility system. Through both an analytical and a numerical case study for the city of Berlin, Germany, we showcase the ability of our framework
					to compute equilibria of the problem, to study fundamental tradeoffs, and to inform stakeholders and policy makers on the effects of interventions.
					Among others, we show tradeoffs between customers satisfaction, environmental impact, and public revenue, as well as the impact of strategic decisions
					on these metrics.

					Lenses are an important tool in applied category theory.
					While individual lenses have been widely used in applications, many of the mathematical properties of the corresponding categories of lenses have remained unknown.
					In this paper, we study the category of small categories and asymmetric delta lenses, and prove that it has several good exactness properties.
					These properties include the existence of certain limits and colimits, as well as so-called imported limits, such as imported products and imported pullbacks, which have arisen previously in applications.
					The category is also shown to be extensive, and it has an image factorisation system.

					Designing cyber-physical systems is a complex task which requires insights at multiple abstraction levels. The choices of single
					components are deeply interconnected and need to be jointly studied. In this work, we consider the problem of co-designing the
					control algorithm as well as the platform around it. In particular, we leverage a monotone theory of co- design to formalize
					variations of the LQG control problem as monotone feasibility relations. We then show how this enables the embedding of control
					co-design problems in the higher level co-design problem of a robotic platform. We illustrate the properties of our formalization
					by analyzing the co-design of an autonomous drone performing search-and-rescue tasks and show how, given a set of desired robot
					behaviors, we can compute Pareto efficient design solutions.

					The design of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the design of AV-enabled mobility systems are closely coupled. Indeed, knowledge
